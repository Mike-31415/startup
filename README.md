A super cool budget app will be made in this repo!


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Budget Friend is a website that will make budgeting simpler and more user friendly. Having tried multiple different ways of budgeting I decided that it was time for something new. The website will have a simple home page that will allow you to see your budget, edit categories, add an expense, and connect accounts with people. Connecting accounts will allow your expenses to show up in other budgets. The one home page will allow for easy access to all of the information needed when looking at a budget.

### Design

![Design image](placeholder.png)

The design will be clean with action buttons at the top and then information about the budget further down the page with every expense for the last 2 months at the bottom.

    Website->>You: Show on Budget
    Website->>LinkedAccounts: Show on Budget
```

### Key features

- Account linking with other people by sending them a request to their account.
- Add expenses.
- Add and edit categories.
- Send an email to update people about their budget.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - A sign in page and a home page will be added.
- **CSS** - A clean layout with colors that makek it easy to look at.
- **React** - Buttons to add budget items will be used.
- **Service** - Log in, retrieve expenses, retrieve specific budget items, submit category changes, submit expenses, and use gmail API to automate updates [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides)
- **DB/Login** - Budget categories and budget items will be saved in the database based on login info.
- **WebSocket** - The accounts will be able to be connected so budget items will be added to your page if a linked budget adds them.
